TODO List
=========

PostCompiler:
	Inline code to allow Ux and Lx for lower and upper variables named A-Z
	Add else.
	Can't use constants in R-Expr on comparisons.

	? Compiler auto optimise for +/-1 *2/2 *8/8 etc ?? (in base class)

Notes:	


?	object:method() => method(object,xxx) ?

FIXED:Can't compare against 9.
